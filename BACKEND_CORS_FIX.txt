# Backend CORS Fix for WebSocket

The "403 Forbidden" errors in the console indicate that the Spring Boot backend is rejecting the WebSocket connection from the frontend. This is likely because the frontend is running on a port (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`) that is not whitelisted in the WebSocket configuration.

## Instructions

1.  Open your Spring Boot backend project.
2.  Locate the `WebSocketConfig.java` file (usually in `config` package).
3.  Update the `registerStompEndpoints` method to allow the specific frontend origin.

### Example Change

```java
@Override
public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {
    registry.addEndpoint("/ws")
            .setAllowedOrigins("http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:3001") // Add your frontend port here
            .withSockJS();
}
```

4.  Also check `WebConfig.java` or your global CORS configuration to ensure `http://localhost:3001` is allowed for REST endpoints if you are seeing other CORS errors.

5.  Restart the backend server.
