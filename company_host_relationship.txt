RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPANY AND HOST

Based on the analysis of your current frontend code (`VisitorCheckInForm.jsx` and `visitorService.js`), here is the answer:

ARE THEY CONNECTED?
NO. In the current implementation, Company and Host are NOT connected.

EVIDENCE:
1. Independent Data Fetching:
   The application fetches "All Companies" and "All Hosts" separately and simultaneously when the page loads.
   - Code: `await Promise.all([visitorService.getAllCompanies(), visitorService.getAllHosts()])`

2. No Filtering Logic:
   When you select a "Company" in the dropdown, the "Host" dropdown does NOT change. It continues to show the entire list of all hosts in the system.
   - There is no code like `hosts.filter(h => h.companyId === selectedCompanyId)`.

CONSEQUENCE:
- A visitor can currently select "Company A" and "Host B" even if Host B actually works for Company C.
- To fix this, you would need to:
  1. Ensure the Backend `Host` entity has a `company_id`.
  2. Update the Frontend to filter the `hosts` list based on the selected `companyId`.
