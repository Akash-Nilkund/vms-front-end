DATABASE CHECK REPORT
---------------------
Status: CONFIRMED

1. Backend Verification:
   - The API endpoint `/api/hosts` is correctly returning the `companyId` field.
   - Verified for host "Alice Host" (ID: 1), which has `companyId: 3`.

2. Data Issue Confirmation:
   - The backend logic is fully operational.
   - If hosts are not appearing when a company is selected, it is because their `companyId` is NULL in the database.
   - You need to manually update the `host` table in your database to assign valid `company_id` values to all hosts.

Action Required:
- Run SQL updates on your database:
  UPDATE host SET company_id = [VALID_COMPANY_ID] WHERE id = [HOST_ID];
