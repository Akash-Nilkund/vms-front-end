You are an expert Spring Boot developer. I need you to update the backend for my Visitor Management System (VMS) to support two new fields: `idProof` and `gender`.

Here are the specific requirements:

1.  **Entity Update**:
    -   Modify the `Visitor` entity (likely in `src/main/java/com/vms/backend/model/Visitor.java`) to include:
        -   `private String idProof;`
        -   `private String gender;`
    -   Ensure these columns are added to the database (update `schema.sql` or rely on Hibernate `ddl-auto`).

2.  **DTO Update**:
    -   Update the `VisitorRequest` or `VisitorDTO` (used in the registration endpoint) to accept `idProof` and `gender`.
    -   Ensure the `VisitorService` maps these fields from the DTO to the Entity during registration.

3.  **PDF Pass Generation (CRITICAL)**:
    -   Update the `PdfService` (likely `src/main/java/com/vms/backend/service/PdfService.java`) to display these new fields on the generated PDF pass.
    -   **SECURITY REQUIREMENT**: The `idProof` MUST be masked on the PDF.
    -   **Masking Logic**: Show only the first 2 and last 2 characters, masking the rest with `****`.
        -   Example: `A1234567B` -> `A1****7B`
        -   Example: `1234` -> `1234` (or handle short strings gracefully)
    -   Display "Gender" as selected (Male/Female/Others).

4.  **Response DTO**:
    -   Ensure the `VisitorResponse` or `VisitorDTO` returned to the frontend includes these fields so they can be displayed in the UI.

Please provide the complete code changes for the Entity, DTO, Service, and specifically the masking logic in the PDF Service.
