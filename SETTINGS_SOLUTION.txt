SOLUTION: ADDING SETTINGS FOR COMPANY AND HOST MANAGEMENT

I have implemented a new "Settings" page in the Admin Dashboard that allows you to:
1.  Add a new Company.
2.  Add a new Host and link them to an existing Company.

Here is the summary of changes:

1.  **Updated `src/services/visitorService.js`**:
    - Added `createCompany` and `createHost` API methods to communicate with the backend.

2.  **Created `src/components/Settings.jsx`**:
    - This is a new component with two forms side-by-side.
    - **Add Company Form**: Takes a Company Name and Address.
    - **Add Host Form**: Takes Host Name, Email, Phone, Department, and a Dropdown to select the Company.
    - The Host form dynamically fetches the list of companies so you can select one.

3.  **Updated `src/App.jsx`**:
    - Imported the `Settings` component.
    - Replaced the placeholder text in the `/admin/settings` route with the actual `Settings` component.

HOW TO USE:
1.  Log in to the Admin Dashboard.
2.  Click on "Settings" in the left sidebar.
3.  To add a Company: Fill in the "Add New Company" form and click "Add Company".
4.  To add a Host: Fill in the "Add New Host" form, select the Company you just added from the dropdown, and click "Save Host".

CODE SNIPPETS:

**1. visitorService.js (New Methods)**
```javascript
    // POST - Create new company
    createCompany: async (companyData) => {
        const response = await apiClient.post('/api/companies', companyData);
        return response.data;
    },

    // POST - Create new host
    createHost: async (hostData) => {
        const response = await apiClient.post('/api/hosts', hostData);
        return response.data;
    },
```

**2. Settings.jsx (Key Logic)**
```javascript
    // Fetch companies for the dropdown
    const fetchCompanies = async () => {
        const data = await visitorService.getAllCompanies();
        setCompanies(data);
    };

    // Handle Host Submit
    const handleHostSubmit = async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        // ... validation ...
        await visitorService.createHost(hostForm); // hostForm contains companyId
        // ... success message ...
    };
```

**3. App.jsx (Route)**
```javascript
import Settings from "./components/Settings";
// ...
<Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
```
