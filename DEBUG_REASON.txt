ISSUE 1: "EXTRA VISITOR" IN SECURITY CONSOLE
When you click the Blue "Instant Approval" button, the system:
1. Approves the request.
2. Immediately checks them in.
3. Adds them to the "Security Console" list.

The reason you see "Extra" visitors is that **previous visitors were never checked out**.
- If you test with "Akash" and don't check him out, he stays in the list.
- If you test again with "Akash" (or "abc") and click the Blue button, a NEW entry is added.
- Now you see TWO people.

**Solution:**
Always click the red **"Check Out"** button in the Security Console when you are done with a visitor. The Blue button is working correctly; it is just adding to the list of people currently inside.

ISSUE 2: REPORTS SHOWING "CHECKED OUT" TIME INCORRECTLY
You noticed that Reports showed a time range (e.g., "11:29 PM - 12:30 PM") even though the visitor was still "Active".
- This happened because the system was displaying the "Expected Duration" as the "Out Time".

**Solution:**
I have updated the code in `Reports.jsx`.
- Now, the report will only show an "Out Time" if the visitor is actually marked as **CHECKED_OUT**.
- If they are still **CHECKED_IN**, it will correctly say **"Active"**.
