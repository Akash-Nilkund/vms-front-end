VISITOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - CODE WALKTHROUGH (SIMPLE VERSION)

Imagine this app is like a digital security guard at the front desk of a big building.

1. THE FRONT DESK (VisitorCheckInForm.jsx)
------------------------------------------
This is the first thing people see. It's a big digital form.

- **The Form**: Just like a paper form, but on a tablet.
  - It asks for your Name, Email, and Phone.
  - It asks "Who are you visiting?" (You pick a Company and a Host from a list).
  - It asks "What kind of visitor are you?" (Guest, Contractor, etc.).
  - It asks for ID Proof and Gender (new rules!).

- **The Selfie**: 
  - There is a camera button. You upload a picture of yourself so the host knows who to look for.

- **The "Check In" Button**:
  - When you click this, the code packs all your answers into a digital envelope (JSON).
  - It sends this envelope to the "Back Office" (the Server/Backend).
  - It waits for the Back Office to say "Got it!".
  - Then it clears the form for the next person.

2. THE SECRET DOOR (AdminLoginModal.jsx)
----------------------------------------
There is a small "Admin Login" button in the corner.

- **The Lock**:
  - If you click it, a box pops up asking for a Username and Password.
  - This is only for the security guards or managers.
  - If you type the wrong password, it shakes its head (shows an error).
  - If you type the right one, it opens the "Dashboard".

3. THE BIG BOOK OF RECORDS (Reports.jsx)
----------------------------------------
Once the Admin logs in, they can see the "Reports" page. This is like the big logbook security guards used to keep.

- **The List**:
  - It shows a list of everyone who has ever visited.
  - It shows their photo, name, who they visited, and when they came in.

- **The Search & Filters**:
  - Imagine you want to find "John". You type "John" in the search box, and the list instantly hides everyone else.
  - You can also say "Show me only people who visited Google" or "Show me only people who came today".
  - The code does this by looking at the list and hiding the ones that don't match your rules.

- **The Download Button**:
  - There is a button that takes all this information and writes it into an Excel file for you to keep.

HOW IT ALL CONNECTS
-------------------
1. Visitor fills form -> clicks Check In.
2. App sends data to Server.
3. Server saves it in a Database (digital filing cabinet).
4. Admin logs in -> App asks Server for the list of visitors.
5. Server sends the list back -> App shows it on the Reports page.
