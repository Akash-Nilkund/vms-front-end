ISSUE ANALYSIS: VISITOR PASS LAYOUT & QR CODE SIZE

PROBLEM:
The "Visitor Pass" is currently taking up too much vertical space, likely causing it to spill over onto a second page when printed or viewed on smaller screens.

CAUSES:
1. QR Code Size:
   - The QR code is currently set to a fixed size of `160` pixels (size={160}).
   - This is relatively large for a compact pass.

2. Spacing (Margins & Padding):
   - The component uses generous spacing:
     - `my-8` (32px vertical margin) on the main container.
     - `p-6` (24px padding) inside the card.
     - `mb-8` (32px bottom margin) after the details grid.
     - `mb-8` (32px bottom margin) after the QR code section.
     - `mb-6` (24px margin) in the profile section.

3. Profile Image Size:
   - The profile image is `w-24 h-24` (96px), which is prominent but adds to the height.

PROPOSED SOLUTION (To be implemented later):
To fit everything on one page, we should compact the layout:

1. Reduce QR Code Size:
   - Change `size={160}` to `size={100}` or `size={120}`.

2. Reduce Vertical Spacing:
   - Change `mb-8` to `mb-4` or `mb-2` in multiple places.
   - Reduce container padding from `p-6` to `p-4`.

3. Adjust Layout:
   - Potentially move the QR code side-by-side with the details, or make the header/profile section more compact.

DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET (As per instructions).
