ISSUE: Empty Company/Host Dropdowns

You are seeing "Select Company" with no options. This means the Frontend is not receiving data from the Backend.

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

1.  **Check Backend Server:**
    - Is your Spring Boot application running?
    - Are there any errors in the Java console?

2.  **Check Network Request (Crucial):**
    - Open your Browser Developer Tools (F12).
    - Go to the **Network** tab.
    - Refresh the page.
    - Look for a request to `companies` and `hosts`.
    - **Status Failed?** (Red) -> Backend is not reachable (Port issue? CORS?).
    - **Status 200 OK?** -> Click on it and check the **Response** tab.
        - Is it `[]` (Empty Array)? -> Your database tables `company` and `host` might be empty or the API is returning nothing.
        - Is it HTML? -> You might be hitting a wrong URL.

3.  **Verify Database Data:**
    - Run `SELECT * FROM company;` in your MySQL workbench.
    - Run `SELECT * FROM host;` in your MySQL workbench.
    - If these are empty, you need to insert data.

4.  **CORS Error?**
    - If you see a "CORS error" in the Console tab, your Backend `CorsConfig` might need adjustment to allow `http://localhost:3000`.

**Immediate Fix (If you just want to test Frontend):**
If you cannot run the backend right now, I can revert the changes to use Mock Data again. Just tell me "Revert to Mock Data".
