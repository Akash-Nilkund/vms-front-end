WHY YOU SEE "NO RECORDS FOUND":

1.  **Empty Database**: You likely haven't registered any visitors yet. The system starts empty.
2.  **Filtering**:
    -   **Pending Approvals** only shows visitors waiting for approval.
    -   **Security Console** only shows visitors who are already APPROVED or CHECKED IN.
    -   **Reports** shows the history of visits.

HOW TO FIX IT (POPULATE DATA):

**Step 1: Register a Visitor (Create Data)**
1.  Go to the **Home Page** (`http://localhost:3000/`).
2.  Fill out the **Visitor Check-In Form**.
3.  Click **"Check In Now"** or **"Pre-Register"**.
4.  You should see a success message: "Registration successful! Your request is pending approval."

**Step 2: Check "Pending Approvals"**
1.  Log in to the **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin-login`).
2.  Go to **Approvals**.
3.  You should now see the visitor you just registered.
4.  Click **"Approve"**.

**Step 3: Check "Security Console"**
1.  Go to the **Security Console**.
2.  You should now see the visitor you just approved (Status: APPROVED).
3.  Click **"Check In"**. The status will change to CHECKED_IN.

**Step 4: Check "Reports"**
1.  Go to **Reports**.
2.  You should see the record of this visit.

**TROUBLESHOOTING:**
If you register a visitor but still see nothing:
-   **Check Backend Console**: Is the Spring Boot app running without errors?
-   **Check Browser Console (F12)**: Are there red errors when you submit the form?
-   **Database**: Ensure your database is connected.
