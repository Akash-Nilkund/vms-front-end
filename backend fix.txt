The user is reporting an issue where the "All Visitor Reports" table displays "Unknown" for Host and Company columns, even though they are selecting valid options in the check-in form.

Please investigate the `getHistory` endpoint (likely in `VisitorController` or `AdminController`) and the `Visitor` entity mapping.

**Issues to check:**
1.  **Data Persistence:** Ensure that when a visitor is registered (`/api/visitors/register`), the `companyId` and `hostId` are correctly resolving to `Company` and `Host` entities and being saved in the `Visitor` table.
2.  **DTO Mapping:** Check the `VisitorHistoryDTO` (or whatever DTO is used for the history endpoint). Ensure it is correctly mapping the `host.name` and `company.name`.
    - If `visitor.getHost()` is null, it returns null.
    - If `visitor.getCompany()` is null, it returns null.
3.  **Lazy Loading:** If you are using Hibernate lazy loading, ensure the transaction is open or you are fetching the related entities before mapping to DTO.

**Required Fix:**
- Ensure `getHistory` returns the actual Host Name and Company Name instead of null.
- If the data is missing in the DB for past records, that's fine, but new records must save correctly.
- Verify the `Visitor` entity has `@ManyToOne` relationships correctly set up for `host` and `company`.

**Example JSON Response Expected:**
```json
[
  {
    "visitorName": "John Doe",
    "host": { "name": "Jane Smith" }, // OR "host": "Jane Smith"
    "company": { "name": "Acme Corp" }, // OR "company": "Acme Corp"
    ...
  }
]
```
Currently, it seems to be returning null or "Unknown" is being inferred by the frontend because the fields are missing.
