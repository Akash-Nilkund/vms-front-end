Found Code:
The function `registerVisitor` is defined as a method within the `visitorService` object, not as a standalone named export.

```javascript
    // POST - Register new visitor (New Flow)
    registerVisitor: async (formData) => {
        const response = await apiClient.post(`${VISITOR_API}/register`, formData);
        return response.data;
    },
```

Context:
It is part of the default export `visitorService`.
Usage: `visitorService.registerVisitor(formData)`
